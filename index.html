                    Hi! I'm Karen! 
                </p>

                <p>     
                    A Delco, PA native, I currently reside in Collegeville, PA with my husband, Nick, 3 doggos (Hailey, Maggie, Tank), three cats (Zipper, Frankenstein, Dexter) and a flock of eight chickens that I affectionately refer to as the "StormCoopers". 
                </p>
                    
                <p>In my spare time (hahahaha), I can be found inventing new recipes in the kitchen, painting or drawing, reading or binge watching shows on Netflix (current binge: "Younger" and "You"). 
                </p>  

                <p>
                    Currently, I work as a Product Manager for a small company called Relay Network. I love what I do and I'm excited to learn more about what my dev teams do. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My goal is to learn more about Web development and apply these skills to my current role, and potentially grow into an engineer role at my current company. I have an amazing support network, including my family and coworkers, who all want to see my succeed and I am really excited to see where this path leads. 
                </p>
